  </para>

  <sect2><title>Context</title>
  <para>Data driven applications typically end up with built-in processing rules for handling particular types of data, e.g. validation constraints, preferences for specific properties or types, etc. These rules are often encapsulated in procedural code, making them difficult to change. Externalizing these rules as declarative configuration can make an application easier to customize. How can this be achieved with applications that consume Linked Data?</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Solution</title>
  <para>Externalize constraints using annotation properties that are used to drive processing rules or constraints by annotating classes and properties in a vocabulary</para>

  <sect2><title>Discussion</title>
  <para>Simple annotations of classes and properties is a simple and easy way to externalize some common types of application configuration. RDF vocabularies are easily extended with additional properties, making them suitable for extension in this way. Using this approach applications can be very easily tailored to work with a range of different vocabularies. Annotations may encode a wider range of configuration options including: display preferences, validation constraints, identifier assignment rules for classes, and local labelling for classes and properties.</para>
  <para>These annotations would typically form part of the overall application configuration, and would be applied locally, rather than being published to the open web.</para>
