   <emphasis>How can we create unique URIs from data that already has unique identifiers?</emphasis>
  </para>

  <sect2><title>Context</title>
  <para>It is often the case that a group of resources already have a unique identifier. This might be a local system identifier derived from, e.g. a database key; or a global non-URI identifier, e.g. an ISBN.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Solution</title>
  <para>Mint URIs that are algorithmically derived from the existing non-URI identifier. This can be as simple as concatenating the existing identifier or key with a suitable base URI. The existing identifier may need to be URL encoded before creating the URI. It is common to combine this technique with Patterned URIs.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Example(s)</title>
  <para>The BBC programmes website uses URIs that are derived from its existing "programme id" or pid.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Discussion</title>
  <para>Where resources are already associated with existing keys, it is likely that the creation and management of those identifiers will already be supported by a specific technology or process. There is a need to be able to create global URI based identifiers for these resources without creating unnecessary additional overheads in creating entirely new identifiers and/or mapping between URIs and existing keys.</para>
<para>
By deriving the URI from the natural key for the identifier we avoid the need to create a new process for assigning identifiers and largely eliminate the need to have a mapping between the two identification systems.</para>
