   <emphasis>How can we capture some metadata about a collection of triples?</emphasis>
  </para>

  <sect2><title>Context</title>
  <para>There are a number of scenarios where it is useful to capture some metadata about a collection of statements in a triplestore. For example we may want to capture:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>publication metadata, such as the date that the triples were asserted or last updated</listitem>
    <listitem>provenance metadata, e.g. who asserted those triples, or how they were generated</listitem>
    <listitem>access control data, e.g. which user(s) or role(s) can access those triples</listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
  The <link linkend="named-graphs">Named Graph</link> pattern allows us to identify a set of triples, via a URI.But how do we then capture information about that graph?
  </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Solution</title>
  <para>Treat the <link linkend="named-graphs">Named Graph</link> like any other resource in your dataset and make additional RDF statements about the graph itself. Those additional statements can themselves be stored in a further named graph.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Example(s)</title>
  <para>A triple store contains a Named Graph that is used to store the results of transforming a local database into RDF. The Named Graph has been given the identifier of <code>http://app.example.org/graphs/my-database</code> to label the triples resulting from that conversion process. As the source is a live, regularly updated database it is useful to know when the RDF conversion was last executed and the data stored. It is also useful to know which version of the conversion software was used, to track potential bugs. This additional metadata could be captured as follows:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
@prefix ex: <http://www.example.org/> .

#Named graph containing results of database conversion
<http://app.example.org/graphs/my-database> { 
   ...triples from conversion...
}

#Metadata graph
<http://app.example.org/graphs> { 
  #Description of a named graph in this dataset
  <http://app.example.org/graphs/my-database> dcterms:source <http://app.example.org/database/customers>
  <http://app.example.org/graphs/my-database> dcterms:created "2012-05-28"^^xsd:date.
  <http://app.example.org/graphs/my-database> foaf:generatorAgent <http://app.example.org/converter/0.0.5>.

  ...descriptions of other graphs...
}]]></programlisting>  

  <para>In the above example there are two graphs in the dataset: the graph containing the data from the conversion and a second graph containing metadata about the first. An application that needed to identify the date that some triples were asserted can easily do this by querying the metadata graph.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Discussion</title>
  <para>
  The majority of <link linkend="named-graphs">Named Graph</link> uses cases require some additional context to be captured about the set of triples labelled with a graph URI. Describing named graphs in RDF, by using the graph URI as the subject of additional RDF statements, provides a simple way to capture additional metadata relevant to an application.
  </para>
  <para>
  As shown in the above example, a specific "well-known" named graph in the dataset can be designated as the location in which these extra statements are recorded. However it is also possible to use multiple named graphs. In this case we might have one graph for the data and one "parallel" graph that captures the context. For example if we could adjust the above example as follows:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
@prefix ex: <http://www.example.org/> .

#Named graph containing results of database conversion
<http://app.example.org/graphs/my-database> { 
   ...triples from conversion...
}

#"Parallel" metadata graph
<http://app.example.org/metadata-graphs/my-database> { 
  #Description of  named graph in this dataset
  <http://app.example.org/graphs/my-database> dcterms:source <http://app.example.org/database/customers>
  <http://app.example.org/graphs/my-database> dcterms:created "2012-05-28"^^xsd:date.
  <http://app.example.org/graphs/my-database> foaf:generatorAgent <http://app.example.org/converter/0.0.5>.
}
...other named graphs
}]]></programlisting>  
  <para>Using a pair of named graphs per source can quickly lead to a very large number of graphs in a dataset. Some triple stores may not be optimized to deal with a very large number of graphs. However the approach does benefit from flexibility of adding and removing both source graphs and their metadata.</para>
  <para>
  Care should be taken when choosing graph URIs. If an application uses the source document URL of some RDF as the named graph URI then this can lead to confusing statements as illustrated below:
  </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
@prefix ex: <http://www.example.org/> .

#Named graph containing results of HTTP crawl
<http://example.org/person/joe.rdf> { 
  #statements contained in the document, about itself
  <http://example.org/person/joe.rdf> foaf:primaryTopic <http://example.org/person/joe>.
  #date the FOAF document was created
  <http://example.org/person/joe.rdf> dcterms:created "2010-06-01".

  <http://example.org/person/joe> foaf:name "Joe Bloggs".
}

#Metadata graph, describing results of crawl
<http://app.example.org/graphs/> { 
    #date the named graph was created
    <http://example.org/person/joe.rdf> dcterms:created "2012-05-28".
}]]></programlisting>  
  <para>In the above example there are two <code>dcterms:created</code> properties associated with the resource <code>http://example.org/person/joe.rdf</code>. That document is a FOAF description which describes its primary topic and the date it was generated. The second date was added by a hypothetical web crawler that captured the date it stored that information in a named graph. It is possible for a SPARQL query applied to the <link linkend="union-graph">union graph</link> for this dataset to return conflicting information, suggesting that the use of the source URL as a graph identifier is a poor choice. A better alternative would be to add some indirection:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
@prefix ex: <http://www.example.org/> .

#Named graph containing results of HTTP crawl
<http://app.example.org/graphs?source=http://example.org/person/joe.rdf> { 
  #statements contained in the document, about itself
  <http://example.org/person/joe.rdf> foaf:primaryTopic <http://example.org/person/joe>.
  #date the FOAF document was created
  <http://example.org/person/joe.rdf> dcterms:created "2010-06-01".

  <http://example.org/person/joe> foaf:name "Joe Bloggs".
}

#Metadata graph, describing results of crawl
<http://app.example.org/graphs> { 
    #date the named graph was created
    <http://app.example.org/graphs?source=http://example.org/person/joe.rdf> dcterms:created "2012-05-28".
    #source of the graph
	<http://app.example.org/graphs?source=http://example.org/person/joe.rdf> dcterms:source <http://example.org/person/joe.rdf>.
}]]></programlisting>  
  <para>In the revised example a new URI is associated with the results of the web crawl. The web crawler then uses this URI to record the required metadata. By adding a <code>dcterms:source</code> property (or similar) it is still possible to identify which named graph was derived from which source URL. As can be seen a <link linkend="patterned-uris">Patterned URI</link> is used to generate the graph identifier, giving a predictable structure to the store.
